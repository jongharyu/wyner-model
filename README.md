# Learning Succinct Common Representation with Wyner's Common Information

This repository provides a codebase for the paper "Learning Succinct Common Representation with Wyner's Common Information," (2022).

## Credits 
We have written our code largely building upon the following existing code bases:
- An overall codebase design and CUB Image-Caption experiment: https://github.com/iffsid/mmvae
- Frechet distance: https://github.com/mseitzer/pytorch-fid
- Zero-shot sketch retrieval experiment: https://github.com/AnjanDutta/sem-pcyc
